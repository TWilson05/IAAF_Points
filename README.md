The goal of this project is to create a method of extracting data from the World Athletics points tables by parsing the pdf files and interpolating the tables to produce an algorithm that produces a World Athletics point score for a given performance.

Using this data, I intend to extrapolate the results to other events not encapsulated in the tables through bicubic interpolation for the running events or through the use of a machine learning algorithm for other events.
The results of this would be a far more generalized version of the World Athletics points table that can be used for odd events or odd distances such as cross country races.
