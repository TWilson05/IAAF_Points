The goal of this project is to create a method of extracting data from the World Athletics points tables through parsing the pdf files and interpolating the tables to produce an algorithm that produces a World Athletics point score for a given performance.

Using this data, I intend to extrapolate the results to other events not encapsulated in the tables through either cubic spline or 3D interpolation for the function parameters or through use of a machine learning algorithm.
The results of this would be a far more generalized version of the World Athletics points table that can be used for odd events or odd distances such as cross country races.
